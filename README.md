### Hello CFX Community!
Some time ago I made a small, simple UI for esx_shops. I would like to share this with you now.
In the future I might change a few small things in the UI or the script.

Here you have a little **[Screenshot](https://prnt.sc/1u366qe)** of the UI
If you want you can adapt the script to your wishes.

**How to Install:**
1. Choose between the limit and the weight version
2. Edit the **esx_shops.sql** according to your requirements
3. Edit the **config.lua** if necessary
4. Add `ensure esx_shops` to your **server.cfg** if it's not in there yet
5. Add pictures for your items in the shop in **esx_shops/html/img**
   *It should be a .png file*
6. Restart your server and your Ready to use
